SAML Bridge
============================

The SAML Bridge is a separate Java web application that acts as an authentication bridge between a SAML identity provider and Yellowfin's SSO webservices. The bridge will allow you to use your organization's central identity provider to grant users access to your Yellowfin reporting instances. The example also includes an option for auto-provisioning new users that are logging into Yellowfin for the first time. Some development and styling skills may be required to tailor this example to suit your needs.
